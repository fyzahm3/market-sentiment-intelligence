# Market Sentiment Intelligence Platform

This project analyzes stock-related discussions from Reddit to quantify market sentiment in a structured, non-opinionated way.

V1 focuses on collecting Reddit discussions, extracting stock mentions, and producing an hourly sentiment score per stock.

V2 will combine sentiment data with real stock market APIs to provide context-aware insights (no predictions).
